## 📄 

## Executive Summary
****The Challenge:** The Goose Pub, a seasonal restaurant, wants to optimize their upselling strategy.

**The Solution:** I built a custom Python ETL pipeline to analyze the transactional data of summer 2025 to build a customer segmentation strategy.

**The Insight:** Identified a **4% revenue growth opportunity** by targeting **76% of the customer** base with specific upselling strategies for appetizers, main course, and premium beverages.

## Technical Implementation
### 1.Data Engineering (Python ETL)
*Developed a Python ETL pipeline to extract, clean, and structure data from static PDF reports generated by the POS system.

*Validated data integrity against control totals before loading into **PostgreSQL**

###2. The Findings 

**Key Insights:**
Identified that **49% of customers** (generating **33% of total revenue**) are under-monetized. Developing a targeted upsell strategy for these specific groups is projected to drive a **4% total revenue increase**.

Generating **15% of total sales** in a concentrated 4-week window, Group 3 acts as a **'hidden gold mine.'** Despite the low spend variance, this concentration makes the upselling strategy very efficient.

##Recommendations

**GROUP 1 :** capitalize on high elasticity by increasing service rounds to upsell premium beverages and convert appetizers into full meals.

**Group 2 :** Unlock value in this large segment by pushing 'shareable' upgrades—converting single drinks to pitchers and appetizers to communal main courses.

**Group 3 :** Leverage sharing behavior for consistent small gains, while maximizing the specific revenue surge available by increasing staff during Weeks 29–33.

**Group 4 :** Maximize high spending potential through confident, proactive upselling—increasing service rounds to drive drink volume and convert appetizers into full meals.
